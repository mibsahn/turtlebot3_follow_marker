2. ssh into turtlebot and launch the following files
	`roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_robot.launch`
	`roslaunch realsense_camera r200_nodelet_default.launch`

### ROS Camera Script
This script subscribes to the ROS camera node of the R200 camera, receiving the image_raw of the color and depth topics.

### Aruco Tracker Script
This script controls the detection of Aruco Markers within the images gained from the camera. It does this by importing a library of Aruco Markers that will then be compared against anything that is found to be a Marker within the image published (line 60-61).

If a marker is successfully detected, the rest of the code will detect the four corners of the marker and create a box enclosing the marker. From these corners, a centre point of the marker is calculated and displayed on the image.

### Velocity Control Script
